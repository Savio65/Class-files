OOPS---

1. Feasibility study.--understanding of the problem statements

2. Requirements. Functional,Non Functional

3. Analysis.-What is going to done.

4. Design.--UML--unified modeling language

5. Implementation.--

6. Debugging

7. Testing

8. Maintanance.

OOPS-Object Oriented Programming

1. class and objects.

2. Encapsulation

3. Abstraction

4. Polymorphism.

5. Inheritance

Objects--things.

Objects: instance of the class..

Characteristics of Objects:

State.id,name,salary---Attributes: Collection of Attributes
behaviour.--id:101,Name:"Jeeva",--Collection of methods or functions.
Identity---Uniqueness--

Class---Collection of objects to share a common name is called class


Encapsulation: to hide the particular things--

Abstraction: To hide the all the details..

Polymorphism--poly--Many  Morphism--Forms.

--different actions but single way..

inheritance:  Reusability:


Keyword:

self-to load the current instance.

Constructor:

To instaniate the memory

its automatically invoked by the Python compiler..

its special member method.

in Python:
